*State we are in*: Working well <br>
*Why*: Because we fulfil the previous requirements in the checklist. We are not yet accustomed enough to our way-of-working to be in the next one<br>
*What are the obstacles to reach the next state*: We need to get used to our environment more, so the way-of-working becomes natural to us <br>
